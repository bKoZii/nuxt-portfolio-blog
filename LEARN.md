A Minimal Portfolio & Blog Website, Made with Nuxt 3, Nuxt UI and Sanity CMS

The design of this website is inspired by [fayazara/zooper](https://github.com/fayazara/zooper) (Also Built with Nuxt 3!)

## What I've Learned from This Project

This project provided valuable insights into several key technologies:

### Nuxt 3

Gained hands-on experience in building a Nuxt 3 application from the ground up.
Mastered core concepts such as project setup, routing, layout management, and component development.
Utilized Nuxt UI to effectively create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

### Strapi CMS

Successfully configured a Strapi CMS project for content management.
Defined and implemented custom content types to structure and organize project data.
Integrated Strapi API to seamlessly fetch and utilize content within the Nuxt 3 application.

### Microsoft Azure

(Grateful for the opportunity provided by the GitHub Student Pack!)

Deployed a Strapi CMS project to Microsoft Azure.
Configured and managed essential infrastructure components, including the server, database, and Web App Service.

### Vercel

Deployed the Nuxt 3 application to Vercel for efficient and scalable hosting.
Effectively managed environment variables and configured a custom domain for seamless user access.

This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of these technologies and their practical applications in real-world development scenarios.
